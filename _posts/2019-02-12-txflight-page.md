I had the pleasure of creating a website to showcase the youth basketball team Texas Flight Elite Basketball. I loved that
they knew exactly what they wanted and I am happy that I was able to execute on their vision. They wanted
a simple yet eye catching design that brought their target audience the information they cared about most. The website was built
using WordPress and contains many unique features and completely responsive design that looks great on desktop, mobile, and
tablet!

Down below you can see a glimpse of the homepage. Here we have a large banner image to showcase their logo and their sponsorship
with Under Armour. Underneath that they wanted their social media links right at the top so it's easy to find and a click/tap away.
And of course we have a image gallery carousel to show off photos of the team and activities involved.

In this middle section if we scroll down further we quickly get an idea of what the team is about and their philosophy.
We also have a grouping of "cards" that was a design request that I was happy to fulfill. They wanted a badge to show their
association with Under Armour and a "Flight TV" section of the latest news behind the team that updates with the latest post. Another
fun and interesting request that was cool to implement was the sidebar twitter feed so that their audience can see the latest news
from their twitter page.

On another page under the "Teams" menu link, we are brought to a page of the team roster, which was a very important requirement.
Since the roster would need to be updated, I provided a means to allow them to quickly edit/delete/add to the roster using a table
plugin in WordPress.

This is just a glimpse of what you can find here on the website. If you'd like to check the whole page out, feel free
