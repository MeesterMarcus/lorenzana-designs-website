### Should You Always Use Wordpress For Your Website?

Chances are, if you've ever looked to get a website done for your business or personal use, a lot of professionals recommend or work exclusively within the WordPress CMS. You might not even understand why WordPress is recommended so heavily. Here I'm going to do my best to try and clear things up as well as help you make a more educated decision on whether or not WordPress really IS the solution you are looking for or if there is a more optimal solution available to you.

**Why It Is Always Recommended So Heavily:**

* The professional or developer has most of their experience working with WordPress and are comfortable working with it.
* It has an integrated CMS
  * A CMS is a content management system that makes it easier to create new posts, modify existing pages
* It is long-standing and has proven to be a solid solution to website building.
* It's simply popular and as such easier to communicate out to clients and has established a foothold in web design.

**When To Consider Wordpress:**

* You have a very heavy need to create continuous content such as news, blog posts, but you also want to have more CMS control and able to edit the pages themselves
* You have an existing web designer that knows and uses WordPress or are hiring someone who knows Wordpress
* You have an eCommerce or storefront need (although Shopify may be a better alternative)

So, Wordpress sounds like a great solution right? Well in most cases WordPress will get the job done for you. But in other cases, you may want to allow the designer/developer a bit more control in how to develop your page and use a different technology, which in the end will give you the result you are looking for and often better.

For instance, if your business doesn't require really heavy need for blogging or page editing, it may be better to hire someone who can develop a custom solution, especially if you care about performance and security.

**When To Consider Alternatives or Custom**

* You have more specific requirements on how you want the website to look
  * This is the most important. With WordPress you are a bit restricted on how you design your page when using PageBuilders or the default options. You don't have easy direct access to the HTML and often have to design the way they want you to design.
* You want your website to be highly optimized and fast
  * WordPress is a VERY heavy CMS that requires a lot of plugins and unnecessary files that probably you'll never use. This can slow down your page and also might be overly confusing to someone who just wants to create a new post every now and then.
* The website is an application
  * Very important as well. WordPress is not meant for building web applications, (except maybe eCommerce stores). It is possible but is not really meant for it and it will not perform nearly as well as a completely custom solution (writing your own HTML, CSS, JavaScript from the ground up). WordPress is primarily used to manage content. But even then, there are solutions out there where if you just need to create posts, offer the same ability with the performance of a custom solution.
* The website is primarily just a landing page for information about you or your business. You only need to be able to create new posts.
  * Another important point. WordPress is a bit overkill if you all you want to do is having a nice looking website that displays information to the user, such as a business landing page, restaurant, salon, etc.

There are a ton of other things to consider of course, but this is a short summary of how to decide and should help get you started. If all of this sounds very confusing, that is completely fine.
