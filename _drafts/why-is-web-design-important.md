A common question I get asked a lot by a number of people is:

**Why is web design important?**

It is a very good question and while it may seem obvious from the surface, it's important to know precisely why having a good website can be beneficial for your business. If you are a business owner, one of your primary objectives is getting leads, getting more customers to your door, and expanding your reach. Why would having a website help any of that? Why not just spend the money towards only marketing? The simple answer is that almost having a website is a long term investment that pays off in the longer run. 

### Organic marketing

 A nice website design and marketing are not two exclusive things. They are extremely tied to one another and mutually benefit from each other. Marketing helps drive traffic to your website, which in turn leads to a higher chance of them contacting you through a form. A website gives your users a window into your business that they can always reach to learn more about you, the services you offer, and why you are better than your competitors. It also goes hand in hand with SEO (Search Engine Optimization) since you need a website in order to be found and ranked by Google. 

### First Impressions

We all know, when it comes to business, first impressions matter... A LOT. Especially when you take into account the shorter attention span we have with the large amount of data available to us now through our mobile phones and the internet.
