### Web Hosting

Having a beautiful and responsive website is great! Although without web hosting, it won't be publicly viewable for your customers to see and share with others. That's why we also help our clients setup their web hosting, domain name configuration, and more! Configuring your DNS settings, redirecting, SSL encryption, and everything surrounding hosting can be very complicated. Leave that matter to use and we'll ensure that it gets done the right way. We also offer a special plan which requires no hosting cost to you if you decide to use a static website (information website)! If your company fits that requirement, that could potentially save you $500+ a year.

### Search Engine Optimization

Another popular service we offer is Search Engine Optimization also known as SEO. You may have seen this acronym thrown around a lot! Well we're here to help explain. SEO is the process of optimizing your website and company to be found by popular search engines, especially Google. It is a constantly evolving process that helps make your website:

* Crawlable (Easily read by Google)
* Trustworthy
* Optimized for your keywords

The main thing to get out of it is that it will help improve your rankings within Google so that whenever somebody searches "plumber near me" your result will be easier to find. Finally, within this same service we offer Local SEO. I bet you can guess what that is! It involved optimizing your website to be searchable locally. You may have noticed how when you search for something in Google, like "find restaurants near me", it will show results that are closest to you. Local SEO helps bring your local business in the eyes of the user easier.

We hope that this was helpful for you and gives you a better understanding of what we can offer! Feel free to reach out anytime if you have any questions or would like a quote on any of the above services. You can reach us at: info@lorenzanadesigns.com .
