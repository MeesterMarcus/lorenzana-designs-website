                    If you have a business in this digital age, it is vital to have a professional website that users can visit. This gives your users the first impression of your company and establishes trust with potential customers. If you want to appear legitimate, you want to make sure your website is modern, user-friendly, fast, and mobile optimized. At Lorenzana Web Design, we will take care of all of that for you.
                    Having a website is also the foundation on which you can build SEO. You can't target keywords for people to search on Google or other search engines without a website.

                    For WordPress sites, we will ensure that you are correctly set up with hosting so that your website is live and points to the domain of your choosing. However, you will own the hosting and the payment associated with it.
                    If you decide to opt for our static information website (such as this website), we can provide a particular implementation that would require no hosting payments on your part. We understand hosting can seem a bit confusing at times. Rest assured,
                    we'll walk you through it every step of the way and answer any questions you have.

                <p>
                    Technical SEO is a specialized part of SEO which focuses primarily on ensuring that your website can be easily "crawlable" by modern search engines. This usually involves making sure the code structure is easy to read, meta tags are implemented, links
                    are optimized, keywords are implemented, and more. SEO is an extremely broad field with a lot of moving parts. For us, focusing on this one integral part of SEO optimization allows us to build an optimized website that meets our quality standards instead of
                    being stretched too thin.

                <p>
                    Google Analytics is what we would consider another foundational piece of your website. This incredibly useful information will help you see how much traffic is coming to your website, how many times users submitted a form,
                    where your users are coming from, and more. Without Google Analytics, there is no way to tell how your website is performing. We provide Google Analytics as part of all our packages, and we are certified! To take advantage
                    of this technology, however, we recommend signing up with our personalized SEO service so that you can improve upon those statistics.

                    or possibly eCommerce, the process can take 30-60 days.
