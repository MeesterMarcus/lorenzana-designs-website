I"E<p>WordPress is a fantastic tool and is especially useful for when you need a website with a blog or eCommerce integration. It’s also a great way to manage your content and gives you a wide array of plugins for you to choose from. When it comes to Content Management Systems, I honestly don’t think there is a better option out there.
With all that said, sometimes the platform can be a bit overkill for certain websites, especially if your main purpose is to just serve informational content. On the flip side, it may be too limiting in what it does and may not fit the bill especially if you need a web application or website with high customization. While the majority of the time it may be the right tool for the job, let’s do something a little different. Let’s see why WordPress might NOT be the right platform to use.</p>
